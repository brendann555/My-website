						David Lynch’s 1977 experimental horror movie <i>Eraserhead</i> is my favourite movie of all time.
					</b></p>
					<p class = "aft">
						It is surreal, bizarre, and at times horrifically grotesque, to the point that it’s difficult to recommend to people. 
						That’s not to say you shouldn’t watch it: the movie is a cult classic, beloved by fans of experimental horror and film in
						general. However, there are also certain circles of film fans who dismiss it, believing that Lynch’s incessant surrealism and 
						the film’s fragmented, dreamlike imagery is pretentious, devoid of meaning, and self-indulgent. If you have already heard about 
						this movie, than you’d know that it does certainly have a devoted fanbase comprised mostly of pretentious film students and hipsters, 
						but I think that it’s unfair to say that the movie is pretentious — simply surreal for the sake of being “avant-garde”. I think its 
						surrealism is quite beautiful, rich in atmosphere and complimented by a haunting soundscape that sounded like nothing else of its 
						time.

				<div class = "right">
					<p>
						If you strip away the thick coating of surrealism, the movie’s plot can be described fairly simply. 
						But to understand the plot one first must understand the protagonist: an aloof, timid man named Henry (Jack Nance). 
						He is less a character and more a blank archetype, so passive and inactive that it’s unnerving. He’s in a loveless 
						relationship and lives a monotonous life. He has an aura of constant anxiety, and that same nervous, tense energy is 
						shared by most characters in the film. The whole film has a sense of impending doom; constant low level ambient and 
						industrial noises ensure that there is never a minute of silence or calmness in the movie. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The anxiety is only amplified when Henry finds out that his girlfriend is pregnant after she announces it 
						during a dinner with her parents (with one of the most disturbing lines in horror: “They’re not even sure it is a baby!”) 
						And now I can finally start talking about everyone’s favourite part of the movie: the infamous <i>Eraserhead</i> baby.

						When people talk about how they miss practical effects in horror movies, they tend to always bring up John Carpenter’s 
						<i>The Thing</i>. 
					</b></p>
					<p class = "aft">
						Don’t get me wrong, it’s an excellent movie with excellent effects, but I firmly believe that the baby in 
						<i>Eraserhead</i> is horror cinema’s greatest practical effect. The baby’s body is wrapped in bandages, and 
						emerging from the swaddling is an alien, snake-life head. To this day no one knows how Lynch made the physical 
						prop for the baby. I personally believe that it’s just an intricate puppet, but I cannot say that the rumours 
						of the baby being a newborn calf or rabbit are particularly far-fetched (at this point you are probably deciding 
						whether this movie sounds intriguing or something you’ll never ever watch).

					<p>
						And things only get worse from there. The baby’s non-stop crying drives Henry’s girlfriend insane and she leaves him, 
						forcing him to care for the baby all by himself. The baby gets sick (and the practical effects become even more grotesque); 
						the claustrophobic intensity of the movie ratchets up and the surrealism makes the movie begin to feel like a fever dream. 
						Henry cuts his baby’s bandages only to discover that they were the only things holding its internal organs together. 
						It’s weird… really weird. But trust me, it’s a beautifully crafted ending. 
					</p>
					<p class = "heading"><b>
						The movie is ultimately about the anxieties of fatherhood and the fear of settling down.
					</b></p>
					<p class = "aft">
						David Lynch’s daughter was born with physical deformities that required extensive surgery, and that fear is definitely reflected 
						in <i>Eraserhead</i>.

					<p>
						But the movie is also so abstracted away from anything concrete that there is no 
						singular correct interpretation. One could also make the case that the movie is about 
						the anxieties of urban living, and the claustrophobia of industry. The film is deeply 
						personal, not in spite of its surrealism but because of it. I mean, who can say with 
						confidence that their interpretation of surreal imagery is the correct one? It means 
						whatever you want it to mean, and that’s what makes it so good.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class = "aft">
						My favourite aspect of the movie is that it’s filmed entirely in black and white. I’ve always been a fan of black and 
						white movies, especially those that are not doing so due to technical limitation but rather for artistic reasons. 
						The limited range of colours in <i>Eraserhead</i> is used to the film’s advantage: Lynch uses very deliberate lighting to 
						create stark contrasts that serve the horror elements of the film: blood looks black and tarry, and the body horror
						elements shine under bright white lights. The colours also serve the film’s industrial cityscape: the world of the 
						film is so brutal, cold, and uninviting, it would seem out of place to see colours.

				<div class = "right">
					<p>
						Another thing that makes this movie special is its soundtrack. I’ve already brought up the low, industrial 
						groanings that underscores the entire movie, but they are just the beginning of <i>Eraserhead</i>’s soundscape. 
						Mechanical, noisy music builds up with impeccable timing (the more I watch the movie the more I appreciate the very 
						stylish and deliberate editing). 
					</p>
					<p>
						The crushing metallic noises are contrasted by my favourite character in the movie: The Lady in the Radiator. 
					</p>
					<p>
						She lives on a small stage found inside Henry’s radiator. Her voice is hauntingly beautiful as she sings to Henry what 
						is either a message of hope, or an expression of his subconscious suicidality: 
					</p>
					<p class = "quote"><b>
						“In Heaven, everything is fine”
					</b></p>
					<p class = "aft">
						The sound is a character in and of itself, one that drives the uneasiness of the work as a whole.

			<div class = "column">
			
				<div class = "left">
					<p>
						I could go on and on, but it’s hard to describe such a surreal visual masterpiece through text alone. 
					</p>
					<p>
						So, I will simply conclude by saying that <i>Eraserhead</i> was the first movie to make me realize what 
						movies could be. It utilized every aspect of filmmaking: the claustrophobic cinematography, the hypnotic 
						soundscape, the surreal imagery; all of the film’s elements culminated into a wholly unique horror experience.
					</p>
					<p class = "heading">
						If any of this sounded intriguing to you, then give it a watch. <br><br>But don’t say I didn’t warn you.
